Pixelesque
----------

Pixelesque, the most awesomest pixel art editor for android ever.


Building
--------

So you want to build Pixelesque? It's pretty easy.

get processing:
http://wiki.processing.org/w/Android#Using_Eclipse_for_Development
(basically - check out the SVN repo and import processing/android/core as it's own project)

get my multitouch android library:
https://github.com/rjmarsan/AndroidProcessingMultitouch

add them to eclipse
add Pixelesque to eclipse, and re-add them as library projects.

That should be it.
